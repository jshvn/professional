## üíº Josh's professional info

This repository contains a LaTeX project that is used to assemble Josh's resume, curriculum vitae, and cover letter. It also contains a markdown document with a copy of the information from his LinkedIn profile.

The LaTeX code is a modified and simplified version of [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV). For the original work please see that repository. 

The original license has been included in this repository.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to build

Docker must be installed and running before building. I prefer to not install LaTeX/TeX Live on the base system, and use the [thomasweise/texlive](https://github.com/thomasWeise/docker-texlive) image instead to build the resume, CV, and cover letter.

#### Build resume, CV, and cover letter

From the top level directory:

```bash
make
```

The generated `resume.pdf`, `cv.pdf`, and `coverletter.pdf` files will be placed in the [generated/](generated/) directory.

#### Clean repository objects

```bash
make clean
```

This will delete any temporary `*.aux`, `*.log`, and `*.pdf` files.

## üìù How to modify

To modify the documents, just go ahead and modify the LaTeX directly. The [resume/content](resume/content/) directory contains all of the source material used for each of the above documents. 

A custom font, montserrat, was used in the resume to match the fonts on [Josh's website](https://ijosh.com). It is located in the [resume/fonts/montserrat](resume/fonts/montserrat/) directory.

There also exists a file [PROMPTS.md](PROMPTS.md) that contains useful prompts for a GPT to create, modify, and update the document content.
