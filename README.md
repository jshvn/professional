## üíº Josh's professional info

This repository contains the files necessary to assemble Josh's resume, cover letter, and a copy of his LinkedIn profile. 

This repository is a modified and simplified version of [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV). For the original work please see that repository. 

The original license has been included in this repository.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to build

Docker must be installed and running before building. I prefer to not install LaTeX/TeX Live on the base system, and use the [thomasweise/texlive](https://github.com/thomasWeise/docker-texlive) image instead to build the resume and cover letter.

#### Build resume and cover letter

From the top level directory:

```bash
make
```

The generated `resume.pdf` and `coverletter.pdf` files will be placed in this top level directory.

#### Clean repository objects

```bash
make clean
```

This will delete any temporary `*.aux`, `*.log`, and `*.pdf` files.
