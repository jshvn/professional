## üõ†Ô∏è How to build

#### Build resume and cover letter

From the top level directory:

```bash
make
```

The generated `resume.pdf` and `coverletter.pdf` files will be placed in the [resume](./resume/) directory.

#### Clean repository objects

```bash
make clean
```

This will delete any temporary `*.aux`, `*.log`, and `*.pdf` files.
