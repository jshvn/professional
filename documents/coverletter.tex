\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{Overview}
Results-driven engineer with 7+ years of experience aligning machine learning and data science with business goals, leading cross-functional teams, and deploying scalable models and data systems that drive personalization, engagement, and revenue growth.

\lettersection{About me}
% \input{content/aboutme.tex}

Look, I get it—seeing a gap on a resume might raise concerns, especially in today's competitive market. But my resume only reflects part of my story, and it omits a year shaped by life-threatening illness that required hospitalization and significant recovery time.

That experience profoundly changed my life. Facing incredibly difficult challenges and confronting the reality of my own mortality pushed me to become resilient, hopeful, and strong.

As I recovered I hatched a plan to reconnect deeply with myself and to experience the life I thought I had lost, and thus began my journey around the world. I left looking for myself, but somewhere along the way I found so much more.

I'm now eager to resume my career, armed with renewed strength and the engineering skills that made me successful at Adobe. My hope is to find a team open to seeing my potential beyond the gap—someone ready to contribute with new energy and determination.

\lettersection{Why me?}
<fill out with reasons why I am the right pick for this position>

\lettersection{Why \companyName{}?}
<fill out with specifics for this position and company>
