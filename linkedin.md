Products:

* Acrobat, Reader, Scan

Overview:

Developed machine learning models for: new user on-boarding journey personalization in Acrobat, targeting attrition-risk customers for retention offers, identifying usage patterns and association rules for upsell, and other tasks. I also developed a platform-agnostic unified data model for sourcing data, a core python library to manage all data I/O and model artifacts across projects, and mentored multiple junior team members.

### Applying Machine Learning to Cardiovascular Health
##### January 2015 - March 2015

Developed a system for classifying the cardiovascular health of patients based on time series data consisting of their diastolic and systolic blood pressures. Implemented by hand k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and a back-propagating neural network to achieve ~80% classification accuracy on a sample dataset of 39 patients using 10-fold cross validation. Measured performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.
