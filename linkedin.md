## Projects

### Carma - A solution to texting while driving
##### April 2015 - March 2016

My team and I developed a technological solution that solves the 'texting while driving' problem. The application, dubbed Carma, completely inhibits the identified driver from using selected applications on their Android device while operating a vehicle. Some clever code running on the Android device, a Raspberry Pi, and an interface with the vehicle via the onboard OBDII port allows us to accomplish this.  This work was completed under the guidance of Professor Majid Sarrafzadeh. Email me for our final research paper and details!

### Applying Machine Learning to Cardiovascular Health
##### January 2015 - March 2015

Developed a system for classifying the cardiovascular health of patients based on time series data consisting of their diastolic and systolic blood pressures. Implemented by hand k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and a back-propagating neural network to achieve ~80% classification accuracy on a sample dataset of 39 patients using 10-fold cross validation. Measured performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.
